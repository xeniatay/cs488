The final executable was compiled on this machine: linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca

How to invoke my program:

In the `handin/A4/data` directory, type `./rt`.

How to use my extra features:
The extra feature Blinn-Phong lighting is automatically enabled in the program.

I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
sample.lua
sample.png

My program assumes the following:
